            <p>SMILY Pathology stands for Similar Medical Images Like Yours. It is a medical tool used by professionals to detect any sort of cancer known or unknown. This tool was provided for medics in order to help them search
                for any kind of cancers that they may have not found themselves.This reverse image search was made specifically for inspection and cancer diagnosis, as well as tissue.
                This inovation allows the medic to sample the patient on a high 
                resolution image. In the image slide, the dyed areas of the tissue is
                laid out to determine what is what. The medic then
                inspects the area by zooming wherever they see needs
                attention.And that is how this new Google tool 
                helps medics determine whether their patient has a problem or not
                .This innovation will make a huge impact by saving lives of
                many people. This is most likely due to the fact that there is a chance a doctor might have missed anything suspicious that this pathology can find.I beleive that this inovation will not negativly affect the future. But if it did, then it would most likey be because it would take over jobs that medics no longer need to do. This may be possbly true or not.</p>
